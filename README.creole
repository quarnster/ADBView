=== Prerequisites ===
  # The Android SDK should be installed, and ADB should be in your path.

=== Installation ===
    # The easiest way to install this plugin is via the excellent Package Control Plugin
    ## See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control#Installation
    ### Once package control has been installed, bring up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    ### Type Install and select "Package Control: Install Package"
    ### Select ADBView from the list. Package Control will keep it automatically updated for you
    ## If you don't want to use package control, you can manually install it
    ### Go to your packages directory and type:
    ####        git clone https://github.com/quarnster/ADBView ADBView
    # The default command is ["adb", logcat"]. If you want to change this you can do so via the file setting "adb_command"

=== Usage ===
After installation, hit ctrl+alt+d to open up an ADB logcat view.

This plugin is using the zlib license
